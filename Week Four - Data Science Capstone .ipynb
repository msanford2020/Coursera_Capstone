Office real estate is being reviewed as one way to significantly reduce operational cost. Employees can live where they would like, and provide value without taking up office space.\n\n\u201cThree quarters of Americans are now working from home because of the coronavirus. Those that were interviewed said they would like to continue if given the option, and two-thirds say they would consider moving if given that flexibility.\u201d\nThis project will explore the Austin Texas area to see if it is a place to call home as the opportunity to work remote and not go to an office everyday could become a growing trend.\n\nThe analysis for this project will provide those looking at exploring the Austin Texas area and surrounding cities for affordability."
